# Changelog

All notable changes to Pebble will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses semantic version tags.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added unsigned macOS app and DMG build scripts, current-platform desktop build routing, macOS CI packaging, and tagged release DMG artifact uploads.
- Added the macOS `.icns` bundle icon required by Tauri's macOS application bundle.

### Fixed

- Enabled the native macOS Keychain backend for local credential encryption.
- Made search over subject, sender, and recipient short fields case-insensitive for Latin text, and trigger a search index rebuild for older case-sensitive indexes.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Added tray and background-running controls so Pebble can close to the system tray, restore from the tray menu, and keep the close-to-background preference in app state.
- Added localized tray menu labels and status bar copy for background sync behavior.
- Added public privacy policy and terms of service pages for Google OAuth app verification.
- Added English and Chinese language switching for the privacy policy and terms pages.
- Added Cloudflare Workers site deployment configuration for the public site.
- Added the LINUX DO friend link to the English and Chinese README files.

### Changed

- Themed native form controls and focus-visible styling so inputs, selects, textareas, and buttons fit the dark UI.

### Fixed

- Improved attachment download reliability by saving duplicate target filenames with a unique suffix instead of failing.
- Staged local draft, outbox, and sent-message attachments into Pebble's app data directory so downloads no longer depend on the original selected file path.
- Persisted IMAP attachments before notifying the frontend about newly synced messages.
- Refined Gmail attachment parsing so large body parts are not shown as attachments and inline content-ID images stay out of the download list.
- Added clearer attachment download failure messages and backend download logging.
- Fixed the Cloudflare Worker site target and migrated the site config to the JSONC Workers format.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-27

This release includes:

- Gmail, IMAP, and experimental Outlook account support.
- Aggregated mailbox views across connected accounts.
- Local mail storage, search indexing, attachments, rules, trusted senders, and application settings.
- Message reading, compose, drafts, sent mail persistence, local outbox fallback, and pending remote write retries.
- Realtime and near-realtime sync infrastructure for Gmail, IMAP, and Outlook.
- Inbox, search, starred, snoozed, kanban, settings, diagnostics, and pending remote writes views.
- Privacy controls for remote images, trusted senders, tracker blocking, sanitized HTML rendering, and safer attachment filenames.
- Desktop notifications with click navigation.
- Custom title bar with consistent app logo rendering on Windows.
- OAuth client secrets are included in release builds when configured.
- English and Chinese README documentation.
- GitHub Actions CI and tag-driven Windows NSIS installer packaging with SHA256 checksum files.
